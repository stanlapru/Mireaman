This folder has files where I try to get familiar with some stuff before I add them to the actual game code.
Namely, PyTMX, pygame_gui, along some others.

To be honest this may just be a reset of development. The old code is a mess.

Right now the goal is to create a tilemap world (animated one at that) and let the player move. 
After that, add the NPC birds, interaction dialogs and stuff like that. (This will take the longest amount of time, because I'll have to draw sprites) -- Feel free to help out if you want ,_,
After all that is done, we'll be doing the 'education' part of the game.
Eventually - polish, GUI, a "demo" mode and a trailer to impress management.

One big problem - I've got a job and not much time to work on the game. Expectations may not be met, dreams may be ruined. Sorry about that!

If nothing is happening in the "main" code, don't fret - things are actually in the works right now.
